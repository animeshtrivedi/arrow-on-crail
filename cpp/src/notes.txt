So, there are RecordBatchFileReader and RecordBatchFileWriter. These inherit from RecordBatchStreamWriter
and from RecordBatchWriter (and associated reader classes)

Reader takes:

static Status Open([INPUT] io::RandomAccessFile* file,
                     [OUTPUT] std::shared_ptr<RecordBatchFileReader>* reader);

RandomAccessFile is
class ARROW_EXPORT RandomAccessFile : public InputStream, public Seekable -> This I can implement for Crail

Currently this class is implemented by
- BufferReader
- HdfsReadableFile
- MemoryMappedFile
- ReadWriteFileInterface
- ReadableFile
