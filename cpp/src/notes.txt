Arrow building needs boost
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

Arrow C++ readme has some good details.

DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (see ~/cmake.sh)

Import in eclipse: or use KDevelop, that seem to be decent
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ./

gtest/gtest.h: No such file or directory
libgtest-dev install

Then compile it from source:
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev
Note that this package only install source files. You have to compile the code yourself to create the necessary library files. These source files should be located at /usr/src/gtest. Browse to this folder and use cmake to compile the library:

sudo apt-get install cmake # install cmake
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
sudo make

# copy or symlink libgtest.a and libgtest_main.a to your /usr/lib folder
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
Now to compile your programs that uses gtest, you have to link it with:

-lgtest -lgtest_main




So, there are RecordBatchFileReader and RecordBatchFileWriter. These inherit from RecordBatchStreamWriter
and from RecordBatchWriter (and associated reader classes)

Reader takes:

static Status Open([INPUT] io::RandomAccessFile* file,
                     [OUTPUT] std::shared_ptr<RecordBatchFileReader>* reader);

RandomAccessFile is
class ARROW_EXPORT RandomAccessFile : public InputStream, public Seekable -> This I can implement for Crail

Currently this class is implemented by
- BufferReader
- HdfsReadableFile
- MemoryMappedFile
- ReadWriteFileInterface
- ReadableFile
